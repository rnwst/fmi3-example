# FMI3 example

This repository contains all the files to generate an FMU v3. The `Feedthrough` FMU example is taken from Modelica's [Reference-FMUs](https://github.com/modelica/Reference-FMUs) repo. The `CMakeLists.txt` file from that repository has been translated into simple build instructions that can be used as a template for custom FMUs.

To compile on Windoze, open the *Developer PowerShell for VS 2022* (requires Visual Studio 2022 to be installed) and run
```
./compile.ps1
```
